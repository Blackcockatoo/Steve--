# Meta-Pet Freemium Strategy
## "The Temple With Curtains" Business Model

---

## Core Philosophy

> **"A freemium companion app dies the moment free users feel emotionally punished."**

Your pet's love, personality, and core bond are **never** paywalled. What you monetize is:
- **Expansion** (more companions, more evolution stages)
- **Depth** (advanced readouts, genome lab, full emotional spectrum)
- **Delight** (cosmetics, sound packs, visual effects)
- **Convenience** (cloud sync, multi-device, backups)

---

## Tier Breakdown

### 🆓 **Free Tier - "The Soul Garden"**

**Goal:** Provide a complete, lovable companion experience that doesn't feel like a demo.

**What's Included:**
- ✅ **1 companion** (fully featured, not limited)
- ✅ **Core emotional states** (8 carefully curated emotions spanning the full range)
- ✅ **Evolution to NEURO** (2 stages - enough to feel progression)
- ✅ **Core rituals** (feed, play, rest, clean, resonate - full bonding loop)
- ✅ **Base cosmetics** (4 colors, 2 patterns, 2 features)
- ✅ **Particle effects** (capped at 15 particles - still beautiful)
- ✅ **Core soundscape** (2 harmonic scales)
- ✅ **Basic trait display** ("Your pet is a Gentle Spherical creature")
- ✅ **Local storage** (can export pet data)
- ✅ **Full vitals system** (mood, energy, hunger, hygiene - no limits)
- ✅ **Personality quirks** (pets feel unique)

**What's Locked (But Visible):**
- 🔒 Additional companion slots (see "1/1 companions")
- 🔒 Advanced evolution stages (see locked QUANTUM/SPECIATION)
- 🔒 Genome Lab (see teaser: "Unlock to explore DNA")
- 🔒 Extra rituals (see locked with 🔒 icon)
- 🔒 Cosmetic packs (see beautiful locked packs)
- 🔒 Cloud sync (see "Sync to cloud" with lock)

**Why This Works:**
- Free users get a **real**, **lovable** companion
- They're not punished for not paying
- Locked features are **visible** (transparency builds desire)
- They can see what they're missing without feeling bad

**Conversion Goal:** 5-10% of free users convert to premium within 30 days.

### 💎 **Premium Tier - "The Expanded Garden"**

**Price:** $4.99/month or $39.99/year (33% savings)

**Goal:** Unlock depth, expansion, and convenience for engaged users.

**What's Added:**
- ✅ **5 companion slots** (build a family)
- ✅ **Full emotional spectrum** (all 15 emotions)
- ✅ **Full evolution path** (all 4 stages through SPECIATION)
- ✅ **Genome Lab access** (element webs, bridge scores, trait breakdown)
- ✅ **All rituals** (10 total - attune, explore, meditate, celebrate, dream-weave)
- ✅ **All cosmetic packs** (Celestial, Void, Primal - included with tier)
- ✅ **Advanced particle effects** (40 particles, quantum effects, temporal trails)
- ✅ **All sound packs** (4 scales, adaptive timbre, field sonification)
- ✅ **Cloud sync** (pets backed up across devices)
- ✅ **Multi-device support** (phone + tablet + web)
- ✅ **Personality drift** (pets evolve based on how you raise them)
- ✅ **Self-regulation behaviors** (pets meet their own needs)
- ✅ **Advanced stats** (drive meters, consciousness readout)
- ✅ **Breeding** (create new companions from existing ones)
- ✅ **Trading** (share companions with friends)

**Why This Works:**
- Clear value proposition ($5/month for 5 companions = $1/companion)
- Unlocks **expansion** (more slots), **depth** (genome lab), and **convenience** (sync)
- Annual plan saves $20 (creates commitment)
- Users who love 1 companion will want more

**Conversion Goal:** 60% choose monthly, 40% choose annual.

### 🌌 **Mythic Tier - "The Cathedral"**

**Price:** $9.99/month or $79.99/year (33% savings) or $199.99 lifetime

**Goal:** Serve power users who want the full mathematical/technical experience.

**What's Added (Beyond Premium):**

- ✅ **Priority feature requests** (influence roadmap)
- ✅ **Early access to new features**

**Why This Works:**

- Mythic users become evangelists (they're invested)
- Technical aesthetic appeals to builder/hacker types

**Conversion Goal:** 5% of premium users upgrade to mythic.

## Pricing Psychology

### Why $2.99 for cosmetics?
- Impulse purchase range
- Matches iOS/Android app store standards
- 3 cosmetic packs = 1 month of premium (creates upsell opportunity)

### Why $9.99 for Mythic?
- Clear 2× premium value
- Still under $10/month threshold
- Matches "power user" tier pricing (Spotify Premium, Discord Nitro)

### Why $199.99 lifetime?
- 20 months of premium (realistic ROI)
- Creates large revenue spike
- Converts evangelists into paying customers
- "Founding member" status (social proof)

## Avoiding Dark Patterns

### ❌ **Don't Do This:**
- Lock basic care actions (feeding, cleaning)
- Make pets "sick" or "unhappy" if you don't pay
- Fake urgency ("Your pet will die without premium!")
- Hide pricing until last minute
- Make cancellation difficult
- Punish free users with degraded pet behavior

### ✅ **Do This:**
- Transparent pricing (show tiers upfront)
- Easy cancellation (1-click, no questions)
- Clear value proposition ("Unlock 5 more companions")
- Gentle upgrade hints ("✨ Explore the Genome Lab")
- Celebrate free tier ("Your companion loves you!")
- Trial periods (7-day free trial for premium)

---

## Paywall Messaging Examples

### Companion Limit:
**Bad:** "You can't have more pets without paying!"
**Good:** "Your companion thrives! Want to nurture more souls at once? ✨"

### Genome Lab:
**Bad:** "Premium feature locked"
**Good:** "Dive deeper into the mathematical DNA that makes your companion unique 🔬"

### Evolution Stages:
**Bad:** "Pay to unlock evolution"
**Good:** "Your companion can evolve even further with Premium access 🌟"

### Cloud Sync:
**Bad:** "Your data will be lost without sync"
**Good:** "Keep your companions safe across all your devices ☁️"
